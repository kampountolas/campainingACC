## Welcome to campainingACC project

"campaigningACC" is a collaborative research project between the [University of Thessaly](https://www.uth.gr/en) (represented by the [Automatic Control and Autonomous Systems Laboratory](http://control.mie.uth.gr/)) and [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch) (represented by the [Institute for Transport Planning and Systems](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch)). The project is supported by the [Center of Research, Innovation and Excellence (CRIE)](https://www.uth.gr/en/research/units/center-research-innovation-and-excellence-crie) of the [University of Thessaly](https://www.uth.gr/en).

## Background
Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to significantly improve road traffic. Connectivity and automation will come in different deployment [levels](https://www.aptiv.com/en/insights/article/what-are-the-levels-of-automated-driving) and the penetration rate of such vehicles on public roads is limited but constantly increasing. More specifically, most commercial vehicles sold today are equipped with [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems) such as the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) that control the longitudinal and lateral position of the vehicle. Some vehicles already offer autopilot functionalities mainly for motorways and soon for urban environments. Such systems are widely considered as predecessors of future fully autonomous driving systems. Their penetration rate in the fleet is constantly increasing, as well as their use, especially under freeway conditions. At the same time, limited information is openly available on how these systems operate and their differences depending on the vehicle manufacturer or model. This represents an important gap because as the number of ACC vehicles on the road increases, traffic dynamics on freeways may change accordingly, and new collective phenomena, which are only marginally known at present, could emerge.

Only a few test-campaigns had been carried out worldwide studying the ACC impacts under real-world driving conditions in quantitative terms. However, it is already apparent that they introduce new driving behaviors and patterns in comparison to human drivers. In many cases, such behavior may in fact bring downsides on the level of service in future road transport systems, due to relatively high reaction times, string instability, and high energy consumption under non-equilibrium conditions. The project campaigningACC will attempt to identify commonalities and differences between human driving behaviors and novels ones introduces by partially automated vehicles. This campaign will attempt to collect data primarily for human drivers. ACC-driven data are also welcome in case the specifications of the vehicle allow it.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kampountolas/campainingACC/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kampountolas/campainingACC/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
